<p>iPAD HARDCOVER CASE</p>

<p>This is a high quality padded hardcover case that feels sturdy while holding, yet is slim, lightweight, soft, durable and very comfortable to use with your iPad. Each cover features chipboard reinforcement (the hardcover) and padding. Also protects your iPad from damage, scratches, dust, smudges and it just looks really cool!</p>

<p>This hardcover folds over, so you can easily hold it while using your iPad. Interior corners securely hold your iPad in place. There is a button hole in one corner to plug in your headphones. Charging port is easily accessible, and the sound from your iPad is great when using this cover. There are 2 stand positions, one at the perfect typing angle and one at the perfect viewing angle. Well placed Velcro firmly holds the cover when used in any of the positions. Designed by iPad lovers for iPad lovers! I personally use this cover for my iPad and just love it. I think you will too!</p>
